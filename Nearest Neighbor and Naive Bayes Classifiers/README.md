# Satellite Images

The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3
neighborhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated
with the central pixel in each neighborhood. The aim is to predict this
classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database,
the class of a pixel is coded as a number.

# Classifying Music Genre

This dataset consists of 191 continuous variables measured from an audio sample from a piece of music.  All audio samples were of the same length timewise. The aim is to classify the genre of the piece of music into one of the following genres: Blues, Classical, Jazz, Metal, Pop, and Rock. These data are contained in two files: GenreTrain.csv (n = 10,000 samples) and GenreTest.csv (n = 2,495 samples).

# Oil Type Based on Fatty Acid Content

The file Oils.csv (n = 96) contains fatty acid content readings for samples of seven types of oils (pumpkin, sunflower, peanut, olive, soybean, rapeseed, and corn). The fatty acids measured are: Palmitic, Stearic, Oleic, Linoleic, Linolenic, Eicosanoic, and Eicosenoic. The aim is to classify those fatty acids into one of the following Type of Oil categories: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
