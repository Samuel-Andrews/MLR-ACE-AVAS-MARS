# SATELLITE IMAGE DATA

# Data Description

The goal here is to predict the type of ground cover from a satellite image broken up into pixels.
Description from UCI Machine Learning database:

The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighborhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighborhood. The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number. 

The Landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene. The interpretation of a scene by integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions including multispectral and radar data, maps indicating topography, land use etc. is expected to assume significant importance with the onset of an era characterized by integrative approaches to remote sensing (for example, NASA's Earth Observing System commencing this decade). Existing statistical methods are ill-equipped for handling such diverse data types. Note that this is not true for Landsat MSS data considered in isolation (as in this sample database). This data satisfies the important requirements of being numerical and at a single resolution, and standard maximum-likelihood classification performs very well. Consequently, for this data, it should be interesting to compare the performance of other methods against the statistical approach. 

One frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels. 

The database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighborhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighborhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. The number is a code for the following classes: 

Number Class 
1 red soil 
2 cotton crop 
3 grey soil 
4 damp grey soil 
5 soil with vegetation stubble 
6 mixture class (all types present)  
7 very damp grey soil 

Note: There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset. 

The data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset. 

In each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. 

```{r}
setwd(getwd())
SATimage = read.csv("SATimage.csv")
SATimage = data.frame(class=as.factor(SATimage$class),SATimage[,1:36])
```

This command makes sure that the response is interpreted as a factor (categorical) rather than as a number.  Use the SATimage as the data frame throughout.

Create a test and training set using the code below:

```{r}
set.seed(888)
testcases = sample(1:dim(SATimage)[1],1000,replace=F)
SATtest = SATimage[testcases,]
SATtrain = SATimage[-testcases,]
```


# K-NN and Naïve Bayes Classification Models

We will be comparing k-NN classification and Naïve Bayes classification for predicting the test cases in SATtest

Mounting Libraries

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(kknn)
require(class)
require(klaR)
```

Nearest Neighbor classification missclassification function:

```{r}
misclass = function(fit,y) {
temp <- table(fit,y)
cat("Table of Misclassification\n")
cat("(row = predicted, col = actual)\n")
print(temp)
cat("\n\n")
numcor <- sum(diag(temp))
numinc <- length(y) - numcor
mcr <- numinc/length(y)
cat(paste("Misclassification Rate = ",format(mcr,digits=3)))
cat("\n")
}

```


Scaling was considered, but since the variables are all in the same scale, it was deemed unescescary.


# Nearest Neighbor Classification:

Starting with just a simple kn = 1 model
```{r}
sat.sknn = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=1)
yhat = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat$class,SATtest$class)

```

Even before putting work, we are only above wrong about 10% of the time, which for minimal effort is quite impressive. However, we can still attempt to improve this by modifying additional features.

First, we will attempt to optimize our number of neighbors.
```{r}

sat.sknn = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=2)
yhat = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat$class,SATtest$class)

```


```{r}

sat.sknn = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3)
yhat = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat$class,SATtest$class)
```


```{r}
sat.sknn = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=4)
yhat = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat$class,SATtest$class)

```


```{r}
sat.sknn = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=5)
yhat = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat$class,SATtest$class)
```


```{r}
sat.sknn = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=6)
yhat = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat$class,SATtest$class)
```


```{r}
sat.sknn = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=7)
yhat = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat$class,SATtest$class)
```


```{r}
sat.sknn = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=8)
yhat = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat$class,SATtest$class)
```


```{r}
sat.sknn = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=9)
yhat = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat$class,SATtest$class)
```


```{r}
sat.sknn = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=10)
yhat = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat$class,SATtest$class)
```

Incresing the number of nearest neighbors beyond this doesn't make a lot of sense given the pattern were seeing. While the imporvment is around 1%, kn = 3 performs the best.


```{r}
sat.sknn3 = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3)
yhat3 = predict(sat.sknn,newdata=SATtest)

```

Next, weighting will tried in a manner similar to more traditional nearest neighbor regression.


```{r}
sat.sknn3w = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, gamma = 1)
yhat3w = predict(sat.sknn3w,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat3w$class,SATtest$class)
```
Immediate results aren't boading well, but perhaps this changes with weight increases.


```{r}
sat.sknn3w = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, gamma = 2)
yhat3w = predict(sat.sknn3w,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat3w$class,SATtest$class)
```


```{r}
sat.sknn3w = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, gamma = 3)
yhat3w = predict(sat.sknn3w,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat3w$class,SATtest$class)
```


```{r}
sat.sknn3w = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, gamma = 4)
yhat3w = predict(sat.sknn3w,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat3w$class,SATtest$class)
```


```{r}
sat.sknn3w = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, gamma = 4)
yhat3w = predict(sat.sknn3w,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat3w$class,SATtest$class)
```

```{r}
sat.sknn3w = sknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, gamma = 5)
yhat3w = predict(sat.sknn3w,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhat3w$class,SATtest$class)
```

Weighting clearly isn't the answer, as with rbf up to 5 we almost are up to predicintingg wrong everytime, with any weight at all doubling our missclassification rate. Perhaps by using the manhattan or taxi cab metric we can see some actual improvement.

```{r}
 
sat.knnD = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c("triangular", "rectangular", "epanechnikov", "optimal"), distance = 1)  
yhatD = predict(sat.knnD,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD,SATtest$class)

```


```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c("triangular", "rectangular", "epanechnikov", "optimal"), distance = 2)  
yhatD2 = predict(sat.knnD2,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD2,SATtest$class)

```

```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c("triangular", "rectangular", "epanechnikov", "optimal"), distance = 3)  
yhatD2 = predict(sat.knnD2,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD2,SATtest$class)

```

Putting more emphasis on Mikowski distance isn't helping, perhaps modifying the kernel will make a difference.

```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=1, kernel=c("triangular", "epanechnikov", "optimal"), distance = 3)  
yhatD2 = predict(sat.knnD2,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD2,SATtest$class)
```

removing rectangular did not help, even being the simplest.

```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c("triangular", "rectangular", "epanechnikov", "optimal", "biweight"), distance = 1)  
yhatD2 = predict(sat.knnD2,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD2,SATtest$class)
```

Adding biweight as an additional helped, but what if triweight pushes it further?

```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c("triangular", "rectangular", "epanechnikov", "optimal", "biweight", "triweight"), distance = 1)  
yhatD2 = predict(sat.knnD2,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD2,SATtest$class)
```

It does the same. What if we do just triweight?

```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c("triangular", "rectangular", "epanechnikov", "optimal", "triweight"), distance = 1)  
yhatD2 = predict(sat.knnD2,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD2,SATtest$class)
```

Having both was definetly holding us back.



```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c("triangular", "rectangular", "epanechnikov", "optimal", "triweight", "gaussian"), distance = 1)  
yhatD2 = predict(sat.knnD2,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD2,SATtest$class)
```

Guassian as an addition did not help.

```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c("triangular", "rectangular", "epanechnikov", "optimal", "triweight", "cos"), distance = 1)  
yhatD2 = predict(sat.knnD2,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD2,SATtest$class)
```

A similar sotry with a cos addition. Perhaps we need to make the model simpler.

```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c( "rectangular", "epanechnikov", "optimal", "triweight"), distance = 1)  
yhatD2 = predict(sat.knnD2,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD2,SATtest$class)
```


This leaves our best model as a triweghit kn = 3 model with Minkowski distance of 1

```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c("triweight"), distance = 1)  
yhatD2 = predict(sat.knnD2,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yhatD2,SATtest$class)
```

Overall, from the simplest model, we improved classification performance by around 2%.


# Naïve Bayes:

Packages

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
require(e1071)
require(s20x)
```

Given the high number of variables we are working with, checking all of them for normality is not practical. It will be far more efficent to simply run the analysis assuming both potential conditions and see which performs better.

Starting simple with klar's implementation.

```{r}
sat.NB = NaiveBayes(class~.,data=SATtrain)

summary(sat.NB)
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
yprednb = predict(sat.NB,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yprednb$class,SATtest$class)


```


Given that assuming a conditional normal distribution for each predictor lead us to a result with more twice the missclassification rate of even the simplest nearest neighbor model, we likely are oging to want to consider more advnaced models using smoothers.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sat.NB = NaiveBayes(class~.,data=SATtrain, usekernel = T)
yprednb = predict(sat.NB,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yprednb$class,SATtest$class)

```

An improvement for sure, but still far behind a result we would consider good. Perhaps if we force the kernel to be more smooth we will get a result more desireable.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sat.NB = NaiveBayes(class~.,data=SATtrain, usekernel = T, bw = T)
yprednb = predict(sat.NB,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yprednb$class,SATtest$class)

```

No difference is made apparent. Perhaps a different library, such as e1071, has a slight edge over klar for this problem.


```{r}
sat.NB = naiveBayes(class~.,data=SATtrain)
yprednb = predict(sat.NB,newdata=SATtest)

misclass(yprednb,SATtest$class)
```


It seems that it made no difference. Our kernel smoothed Klar model comes out on top.


Final Models:

Nearest-Neighbor:
```{r}
sat.knnD2 = train.kknn(class~.,data=SATtrain,kn=3, kernel=c("triweight"), distance = 1)
```
Missclassification Rate = 8.3%

Naive-Bayes:
```{r}
sat.NB = NaiveBayes(class~.,data=SATtrain, usekernel = T, bw = T)

```
Missclassification Rate = 18.3%


# Monte Carlo Cross-Validation

Using Split-Sample Monte Carlo cross-validation to compare k-NN and Naïve Bayes to compare these methods of classification. 

First, we will look at our k-NN model.

## Monte Carlo Function for k-NN:

```{r}
kknn.sscv = function(train,y=train[,1],B=25,p=.333,kmax=3,kernel="optimal",distance=2) {
  y = as.factor(y)
  data = data.frame(y=y,train[,-1])
  n = length(y)
  cv <- rep(0,B)
  leaveout = floor(n*p)
  for (i in 1:B) {
    sam <- sample(1:n,leaveout,replace=F)
    fit <- train.kknn(y~.,data=data[-sam,],kmax=kmax,kernel=kernel,distance=distance)
    ypred = predict(fit,newdata=data[sam,])
    tab <- table(y[sam],ypred)
    mc <- leaveout - sum(diag(tab))
    cv[i] <- mc/leaveout
  }
  cv
}

```

Result:

```{r}
#results = kknn.sscv(SATimage,B=100,kmax=3,kernel="triweight", distance = 1, p = 0.33)

#summary(results)
```
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
0.08808 0.09756 0.10196 0.10159 0.10586 0.11856 

Over 100 iterations, it seems that our observed metric of 8.3% missclassification was on the low end for a model of that type. Still, averaging about 11% is not horrible, but the result was not what one might have fully hoped for.


## Monte Carlo Function for Naive Bayes

```{r}
nB.cv = function(X,y,B=25,p=.333,laplace=0) {
y = as.factor(y)
data = data.frame(y,X)
n = length(y)
cv <- rep(0,B)
leaveout = floor(n*p)
for (i in 1:B) {
        sam <- sample(1:n,leaveout,replace=F)
        temp <- data[-sam,]
        fit <- naiveBayes(y~.,data=temp,laplace=laplace)
        pred = predict(fit,newdata=X[sam,])
        tab <- table(y[sam],pred)
        mc <- leaveout - sum(diag(tab))
        cv[i] <- mc/leaveout
        }
  cv
}

```

Result:

```{r}
#results2 = nB.cv(SATimage[,-1],SATimage[,1],B=100)

#summary(results2)
```
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 0.1809  0.1963  0.2033  0.2031  0.2087  0.2256 

Naive-Bayes peformed similarly, being slightly worse through 100 passes in a Monte Carlo function. However, it still holds true that our k-NN model is roughly twice as effective than Naive-Bayes using missclassification as our chosen metric, with the average pass for Bayes garnering wrong answers anout 20% of the time compared to 10% from k-NN.
